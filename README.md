**Description :spiral_notepad:  :** 

:wave:  Hey guys, I've always wanted to fight against peds in my Freeroam but the only way I had to do so was by going to Groove Street and fight the Ballas :purple_circle: 
So I had the idea to develop a script that spawns aggressive peds in the world, so you can fight against them and have fun :smile:

**Usage :hammer_and_wrench: :**

To use the resource, download it, create a folder named `mth-aggressive` in your main resources folder and put the files in there and add `start mth-aggressive` to your server.cfg
Then, once you're in game, use the command /aggressive

**Features :sparkles: :**
* The peds will spawn with a random gun from a list (you can edit it to add any weapon you want)
* The peds model is randomly selected from a list (you can edit it to add any model you'd like to spawn)
* Implemented a cooldown to avoid spamming (you can customize it)
* Spawned peds will have a blip on the map
* Spawned peds **won't attack each other** 
* You can delete all spawned peds
* You can set the maximum amount of peds you want to allow players to spawn

*Demo :eyes:  :*

Note that I released a similar resource about a year ago, but I decided to remake it because I have more experience with Lua now and I wanted to improve it :smile:
